# Overview

This is my first attempt at making a game using Unity in order to learn how to use the engine and connect different aspects.

This game is meant to be a vocab learning game. Currently, the words are in Tagalog and it sends little animal sprites down the screen. The user types the name of the sprite in the input box. After a certain number of correct answers, another animal is added to the gameplay and the oldest animals are sped up.

I have been wanting to learn vocabulary in my target language for awhile but I wanted an app that could help me do so visually. When a little kid learns, they don't look at a bird and translate from english "bird" to "ibon". They simply see the object and think "ibon." This is what I was trying to emulate.
